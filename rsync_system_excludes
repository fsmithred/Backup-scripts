# rsync excludes for system backup
# You can comment out or add lines as needed.
# Anything listed here will NOT be backed up.
# Note that /home is set to be excluded from backup.

- /proc/
- /lost+found/
- /dev/
- /mnt/
- /media/
- /sys/
- /tmp/
- /home/


# Some others that might be useful if you commented out /home/ above (i.e. if you
# will be backing up /home).
# I'm not sure if all of these work right. 
# Tested while running as user from home.
# '- */Cache/' is right for browser cache, and '- .cache' is right for ~/.cache
# '- */Trash/* keeps .local/share/Trash/ but it's empty.
# same with '- /.thumbnails/* but
# '- .mozilla/' results in no .mozilla directory.


#- */Trash/*
#- /.thumbnails/*
#- */Cache/*
#- .cache
#- /.macromedia/
#- /.adobe/
#- .mozilla/
# These next two should exclude all of .mozilla except for bookmarkbackups. (untested)
#- .mozilla/*
#+ .mozilla/*/bookmarkbackups
